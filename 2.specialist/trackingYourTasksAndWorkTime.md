# Tracking your tasks and work time

Read [this cheat sheet](https://github.com/dewv/procedures/blob/master/pomodoro_cheat_sheet.pdf) for a time management approach called the Pomodoro technique. The document contains markup and annotations that modify the instructions for use with [GitHub Issues](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-your-work-with-issues/).

You will use these instructions to track your working time on tasks recorded as GitHub Issues.

Your performance will be evaluated on the quality and quantity of the work you perform, *as recorded in GitHub Issues using the Pomodoro technique*.

Remember:

- if it is not documented in a GitHub Issue/comment, it "didn't happen"
- if the time is not recorded in an Issue comment using the Pomodoro cheat sheet instructions, you "didn't work it"

Note that we are working on a project to build a better system for *estimating* and tracking work time with the Pomodoro technique. 

In a traditional internship, students are expected to earn each semester hour with 40 hours of work; this means 120 work hours for a 3-credit course. Until we have more experience using Pomodoro, we will not set an official requirement for total work time. But if you are not working "enough" in the judgment of management, your performance evaluation will reflect this.
