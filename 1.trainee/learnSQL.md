# Learn SQL

1. Study the following tutorials at [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp):
- [ ] SQL Tutorial
- [ ] SQL Database Forms

(Note: each item listed above is a navigation heading in the left margin of the w3schools site. There are multiple pages under each of those headings.)

2. Take the [SQL quiz](https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?Qtest=SQL) until you score 90% or higher, with a time limit of one minute per question. Take a screenshot that shows your score and Time Spent, and add the image to this page.
3. Add the "SQL" skill to your LinkedIn profile. Your supervisor will endorse it.
