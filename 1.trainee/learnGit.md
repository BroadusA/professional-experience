# Learn git

In your previous work, you have probably used git and GitHub at a basic level-- mostly to submit your programming assignments.

It's time to take your git skills to the next level, for working with others in a team setting.

## Tutorial

Begin by completing [this tutorial](https://try.github.io/).

## Applying tutorial content to our situation

- Typically, your "local" repo will be in a c9 workspace. 
- The remote repo will be at github.com.
- In the tutorial, you create a local repo from scratch, then add an empty GitHub repo as remote. Here, you will usually want to start with an existing (non-empty) GitHub repo, and use it locally. The command for this is `git clone https://github.com/NAMESPACE/REPO-NAME.git`. `NAMESPACE` is a placeholder for the GitHub user or organization that owns the repo; our organization is `dewv`. `REPO-NAME` is a placeholder for the name of the repository you will clone. In GitHub, you can easily grab these URLs on each repo's main page, using the green `Clone or download` button on the right side of the page. 

## Configuring git

You will find it easier to work with git if you perform certain setup steps for each of your local repos. See TBD for instructions.

## Our git workflows

There are many different ways to work with git and GitHub. Many teams define "workflows" to communicate how they use the tools. We define two different git-related workflows, which are used in different situations.

Primarily, you will use the "continuous integration" workflow, link TBD. This is the best fit for our software development work.

You should also be aware of the "feature branch" workflow, which is the best fit when creating procedures and other types of documentation. link TBD
