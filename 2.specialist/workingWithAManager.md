# Working with a manager

To succeed, an organization needs skilled managers and staff who are skilled at doing their work while "being managed".

This is especially challenging in organizations, like ours, where work is divided into projects so that staff members may report to more than one manager.

Read [Management Time: Who's Got the Monkey?](https://hbr.org/1999/11/management-time-whos-got-the-monkey). Although you do not manage staff members, you can take two critical types of knowledge from this reading.

1. What behavior should I expect from my manager(s)?
2. How can I avoid common mistakes when "being managed"?

To summarize, you should remember that the monkey is always on your back-- the staff member being managed. Expect your manager(s) to avoid subordinate-imposed time by refusing to accept your monkeys. You and your manager must work together to follow the Five Rules for the Care and Feeding of Monkeys.

> Rule 1. Monkeys should be fed or shot. Otherwise, they will starve to death, and the manager will waste valuable time on postmortems or attempted resurrections.
>
> Rule 2. The monkey population should be kept below the maximum number the manager has time to feed. Subordinates will find time to work as many monkeys as he or she finds time to feed, but no more. It shouldn’t take more than five to 15 minutes to feed a properly maintained monkey.
>
> Rule 3. Monkeys should be fed by appointment only. The manager should not have to hunt down starving monkeys and feed them on a catch-as-catch-can basis.
>
> Rule 4. Monkeys should be fed face-to-face or by telephone, but never by mail. (Remember—with mail, the next move will be the manager’s.) Documentation may add to the feeding process, but it cannot take the place of feeding.
>
> Rule 5. Every monkey should have an assigned next feeding time and degree of initiative. These may be revised at any time by mutual consent but never allowed to become vague or indefinite. Otherwise, the monkey will either starve to death or wind up on the manager’s back.
