# Working with a manager

To succeed, an organization needs skilled managers and staff who are skilled at doing their work while "being managed".

This is especially challenging in organizations, like ours, where work is divided into projects so that staff members may report to more than one manager.

Read [Management Time: Who's Got the Monkey?](https://hbr.org/1999/11/management-time-whos-got-the-monkey). Although you do not manage staff members, you can take two critical types of knowledge from this reading.

1. What behavior should I expect from my manager(s)?
2. How can I avoid common mistakes when "being managed"?

To summarize, you should remember that the monkey is always on your back-- the staff member being managed. Expect your manager(s) to avoid subordinate-imposed time by refusing to accept your monkeys. You and your manager must work together to follow the Five Rules for the Care and Feeding of Monkeys.
