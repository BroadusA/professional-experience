# Learn HTML

1. Study the following tutorials at [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp):
- [ ] HTML5 Tutorial
- [ ] HTML Forms
- [ ] HTML5

(Note: each item listed above is a navigation heading in the left margin of the w3schools site. There are multiple pages under each of those headings.)
2. Take the [HTML quiz](https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?Qtest=HTML) until you score 90% or higher, with a time limit of one minute per question. Take a screenshot like the one below that shows your score and Time Spent, and attach the image to this GitHub Issue.
