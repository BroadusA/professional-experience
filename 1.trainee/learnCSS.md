# Learn CSS

1. Study the following tutorials at [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp):
- [ ] CSS Tutorial
(Note: each item listed above is a navigation heading in the left margin of the w3schools site. There are multiple pages under each of those headings.)

2. Take the [CSS quiz](https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?Qtest=CSS) until you score 90% or higher, with a time limit of one minute per question. Take a screenshot that shows your score and Time Spent, and add the image to this page.
3. Add the "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)" skill to your LinkedIn profile. Your supervisor will endorse it.
