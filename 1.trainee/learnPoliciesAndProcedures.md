# Learn Policies and Procedures

Be aware that we maintain a [repository of policies and procedures](https://github.com/dewv/procedures/blob/master/README.md). Following these is an important part of your job responsibilities.

- [ ] Skim the repo's file listings so that you have an idea of what is covered. 
- [ ] For future reference, check the repo anytime you have a question about "how to do X".
- [ ] Specifically, study the [Personal Leave Policy](https://github.com/dewv/procedures/blob/master/personnel/personalLeavePolicy.md).
