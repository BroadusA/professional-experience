# Professional Experience

This repository is a kind of training manual for students in D&E computer science Professional Experience courses. Each student has their own copy of the repository, so it is also used as your personnel file for performance reviews, plans, etc.

Professional Experience courses create a simulated work environment, and that shapes the language that we use. We are running a company. You are not "students", you are "staff". We have "clients". You have "teammates", not "classmates". We don't hold "class", we have "meetings".

# Welcome

Begin by reading the company's home page at https://dewv.net/. It explains:
1. who we are
2. what we do
3. why we do it

## Our values and priorities

The same ideas can be expressed as a set of values and priorities. This form is more useful as a guide when making decisions.

> As an organization, we value the following things, in the following order.
> 1. Improving our professional knowledge, skills, and habits
> 2. Improving our products and services 
> 3. Improving our world through the development and operation of computer systems

**As a member of the organization, your fundamental responsibility is to *create value*, as defined just above.**

To do that, you need to understa	nd how we work. Your initial training, or "onboarding", covers the technical, organizational, and procedural knowledge you will need to get started. Your onboarding activities are defined in the `1.trainee` folder of this repo.

When your onboarding activities are complete, you will be promoted from trainee to Information Systems Specialist-- a full-fledged member of the technical staff. The `2.specialist` folder in this repo provides guidance on the specific responsibilities of this role, and how to go about meeting them.

If you enjoy the role of Information Systems Specialist, you may repeat CSCI 290 for elective credit in the major. Alternatively, you may request permission to enroll in CSCI 390; this involves an application for promotion to Information Systems Manager. The manager role has a different set of specific responsibilities. The `3.manager` folder in this repo provides guidance for filling this role.

The `personnel` folder is used on an as needed basis. It is the place for your personal feedback, goals, and plans related to your individual professional development.
